# PowerWave Analyzer

PowerWave Analyzer is a Python tool for offline analysis of electrical waveforms stored as CSV files. It computes FFT, harmonic spectrum, RMS values, and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for voltage or current waveforms.

## Features

- Load time-domain waveform from CSV file.
- Compute FFT and magnitude spectrum.
- Detect fundamental frequency and harmonic components.
- Compute RMS and THD for the waveform.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
